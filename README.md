# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This is the project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course
as submitted by Kevin Sterner, May 24, 2015

The purpose of this project is to analyze data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.

Data should be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The script run_analysis.R does the following:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From this data set, it then creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

To run the script run_analysis.R, be sure to set your active R directory to the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory.

The columns of the tidy dataset are described in CodeBook.md.

Enjoy!
